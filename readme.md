***ENJOY!!***

If you do not want this, **you can remove it in the given applications `style.css` and add valid color values.** Although I highly recommend `Pywal` It's Pretty cool!

  ## Overview
  This is my minimal Waybar setup for Hyprland, designed to be clean and efficient. It includes all the essential features I wanted in Waybar. For additional needs like volume control, I use `swaync`, which can be triggered from Waybar. 

  ## Workspaces
  I‚Äôve configured the workspaces so that if there is content on a workspace, the dot appears darker. This helps you keep track of your open content! Inspiration from [Gbar](https://github.com/scorpion-26/gBar).

  ![2025-01-04-030026_hyprshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31668572-b35d-4acb-8525-8cb0e5669101)
  
  ## Expanding Waybar
  In the screenshot below, you‚Äôll see a method to hide and reveal certain widgets you don‚Äôt need all the time. You can easily add or remove widgets in `~/.config/waybar/config` under the `group/expand` section.
  
  - **Network Widget**: I‚Äôve configured it to not display your IP by default (it did that for some reason). Clicking the network widget opens `nmtui` in `kitty`.
  
  - **Hyprpicker Widget**: This custom widget lets you use `hyprpicker`, display values when hovered, and copy the hex value to your clipboard.

  ## Overview
    
  - Hyprlock uses the current wallpaper from Pywal to generate a background, displays a greeting with your username, and applies Pywal colors.
  - You can bind Hyprlock to a key, use it with `hypridle`, or configure it however you prefer.
  - If you want to configure `hypridle` as well, I‚Äôve included a `hypridle.conf` file in the same directory as Hyprlock.

  ### *How To Install*
1. **Install [Hyprlock](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprlock/)**
2. Copy `Dotfiles/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf` to `~/.config/hypr`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cbe58e3-7226-4537-8e69-bb316cdfaebc)





## General Overview

- The `wallpaper.sh` script in `Dotfiles/.config/hypr/` applies a wallpaper using `swww` and sets the `Pywal` theme. It also updates Kitty's color scheme, Cava, nvim (if configured), and any other application using `pywal`.
- The script uses Wofi to select wallpapers. I have not been able to optimize the wallpaper loading so it might load slowly but it should work.

### Dependencies

- `swww`
- `pywal`
- `wofi`
- `fd`

### *How To Install*
- Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     yay -S swww pywal wofi fd
     ```
     
1. **Copy Configuration Files:**
   - Copy `Dotfiles/.config/wal` to `~/.config/` to provide `pywal` with the necessary template for Hyprland.
   - Copy `Dotfiles/.config/hypr/wallpaper.sh` to `~/.config/hypr/`.
   - Copy `Dotfiles/.config/wofi` to `~/.config/`. ( Check the Wofi tab for how to configure blur )

2. Bind the script to a key combination of your choice to easily change your wallpaper.

3. Make sure to add the following line to your `hyprland.conf`:

     ```bash
     exec-once = swww-daemon
     ```

  Firefox
  Python
  Pywal
  ```

 ### *How To Install*
1. **Install [Pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox)**
2. Run `pywalfox install`
3. Install Firefox add-on for PywalFox
4. Run `pywalfox update` in your terminal or add it to a script to update the `Firefox` theme after generating `Pywal` colors.

   ```bash
    eval "$(starship init bash)"
   ```
   - Or go [here](https://github.com/starship/starship?tab=readme-ov-file#step-2-set-up-your-shell-to-use-starship) to find what you need for your shell.

## Help

<details>
  <summary>Apps Fuzzy or Blurry?</summary>
  
  #### This may be because they need to be run with Wayland or are Electron applications
  
  - The solution I found is to add the following to `/usr/share/applications/{app}.desktop` after `exec=/app/executable/app`
  - Works on `Spotify` `Discord`
  
  ```
  --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland --uri=%U
  ```

  - ***NOTE*** This gets removed if the app is redownloaded! I'm not sure how to make this a global thing. I have tried and failed. Help?

<details>
  <summary>Cant Find a file that is in .cache?</summary>

### You may be looking for a file that looks something like this:

`@import url('/home/eli/.cache/wal/colors-waybar.css');`

That file is one of many that is created by `Pywal`. Try replacing eli with your $USER and see if that works. Alternatively, you can do one of the following:

- create your own file which would look something like this:
```
@define-color background <Replace>;
@define-color color0 <Replace>;
@define-color color9 <Repace>;
```
Instead of those colors, you can use whichever color is needed by the style.css file.

- create the colors manually in the style.css files you took those paths from. 
```
@define-color <ColorName> <Color>;
```

- Find the sections of that file that are calling the missing file, such as `$color2` or `@color2` and replace it with a valid value.

</details>



## Notes
- If you want Cava to work with `Pywal`, it is already in the wallpaper.sh, but find the section needed and copy the config file I have into your `~/.config` directory.
- Am about to start working on an eww dashboard so look out for that
